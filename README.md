# Advent of Code 2023

This repository provides boilerplate code so you can jump straight into coding
the challenges from the [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

## Optional dependencies (recommended)

- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Optional setup (recommended)

With pyenv and poetry installed, run the following commands, from the root of the repository, in this order:

1. Install Python 3.12.1 with pyenv:
```bash
pyenv install 3.12.1
```
2. Use pyenv to create a .python-version file that will be used by your shell if you installed pyenv correctly:
```bash
pyenv local 3.12.1
```
3. Create a virtualenv, using the Python version installed above:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
4. Activate the virtualenv created above:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install other dependencies (linter, formatter, etc)
```bash
poetry install
```

> **Obs:** Step #4 is the only one you'll need to repeat (from the root of the repo) after you close your terminal. The previous ones are one time only and the last one should only be repeated if you modify your `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage

Part 1 of the first day is already [implemented](advent2023/d01/__init__.py), to serve as an example.

Implement the solution to day N on `advent2023/dN/__init__.py`. The directory for days 1-9 have a leading 0 as padding, but that 0 should not be provided on the command line, as shown below:

```bash
python3 advent2023 --day 1 --part 1 input/d01/part1_example.txt
```

If you prefer, you can instead redirect the input from stdin, e.g.:

```bash
python3 advent2023 --day 1 --part 1 < input/d01/part1_example.txt
```

### Troubleshooting

> The commands above don't work!

For the first day, the commands above should work even without pyenv and Poetry. You can try running it with `-m`:
```bash
python3 -m advent2023 --day 1 --part 1 input/d01/part1_example.txt
```
Having that said, using the recommended `pyenv`+`Poetry` setup (remembering to activate your virtualenv, e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`) decreases the likelihood of conflicts with your system-wide python installation and its ecosystem.

## Development commands/helpers

_**If** you're using Poetry_, there are some nice commands to lint, format and clean your files (they assume your virtualenv location is `.venv`, at the root of the project):

```bash
make all
```

```bash
make lint
```

```bash
make fmt
```

```bash
make clean
```

## Extra info

### How does this repo work?

The entry point for every day/part is [this file](advent2023/__main__.py). It reads the command line options/arguments and accepts either an input file path directly or content from stdin. It imports the module that matches the provided day (e.g., `advent2023.d08` for `--day 8`), then calls either the `part_1(lines)` or `part_2(lines)` function of that module (both located in `advent2023/dXX/__init__.py`)

### I want to modify the way the input is parsed

In the file [linked](advent2023/__main__.py) above, the default is to read the input and return a list of strings, one for each line. This might not be desirable for every day of the challenge. Since this repo is only a template to get started with the challenge, the modifications to parse input in a different manner are left as an exercise for the programmer ðŸ˜‰
